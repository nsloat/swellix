# swellix
Here, we'll cover some of the basics of computing with Swellix.


First: Compiling Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### THE VIENNA PACKAGE:<br>
Swellix uses some utilities provided in the ViennaRNA package for computing thermodynamics and RNA distance in structures.
When you download Swellix, you should get a copy of Vienna: `ViennaRNA-2.2.5.tar`
To configure Swellix in a simple way, you'll first need to decompress the ViennaRNA tarball in the same directory as
the Swellix Makefile:<br>
```
tar -xf ViennaRNA-2.2.5.tar
```

You should now have a new directory called "ViennaRNA-2.2.5." The next step is to compile the ViennaRNA
library:<br>
```
make vienna
```

This should populate the `viennabuild` directory with the resources that Swellix will use during computation. Inside of this
`viennabuild` directory, there will be an existing thermodynamic parameter file called `rna_turner2004.par`. This file
informs the calculations that are performed at runtime to determine the free energy of a secondary structure. If you have
a different or updated parameter file that you'd like to use then you can simply replace `rna_turner2004.par` with your
file. For this file to be properly used, you must also make a change to the Swellix Makefile. In the Makefile, there is a
variable `PARAMFILE`. In this variable, you must change `rna_turner2004.par` to the name of the file you want to use.


Second: Compiling Swellix
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Swellix Makefile has gathered multiple options for compilation. The ones of most use are:

### SERIAL:
Compilation using 
```
make serial
```
will provide the serial version of Swellix with the most basic needed output. The program
will output the RNA sequence it was given, and the number of structures computed. You may provide Swellix the commandline
flag `-d` with a value of 2 to print each structure out in dot & parenthesis format to the terminal as it is computed.


### MPI:
Using
```
make mpi
```
will produce a result similar to `make serial` except the code will be compiled to run using the parallel
version of the algorithm. Once compiled, you should be able to run Swellix with `mpirun` or the like.

**_NOTE_**
The parallel code in Swellix was developed using OpenMPI, so problems could arise if using some other implementation of MPI.


### DISP (Display):
Compiling with
```
make disp
```
instructs Swellix to provide various levels of more detailed output. These levels depend on the
`-d` flag as detailed at the bottom of this file in the table of commandline options.
Level 1 is the same as the default output from using `make serial` above except with more information relating to the data
structures that were used in the algorithm. This information is mainly the size of some lists. 
Exceeding Level 2 results in output which is really only useful for debugging or further development. 

**_NOTE_**
If you do choose to use the `-d` option for more detailed output, be wary of the size of your sequence and possible size of
output. You can easily generate very large files from the output of structures alone. This is not to mention the debugging
text if you have the display level set high enough. It all comes down to your imposed constraints.


Third: Input Format
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Swellix RNA sequence input must be formatted properly before being run in the program.


### GUIDELINES/RULES:
The first rule is the simplest, and we'll call it the 'One Line Rule'. Any input sequence should occupy only one line.

e.g.
Say you have some arbitrary sequence `GCUCUAAAAGAGAG`. You shouldn't create an input file with your sequence formatted on 
two lines like this:
```
GCUCUAA
AAGAGAG
```
This is because it contains a new line indicator after the first 7 nucleotides. Swellix can't tell if the two lines are
meant to be the same sequence or if you're trying to give it some kind of multi-sequence input, which the program doesn't
currently handle. The result of this input would be Swellix running with only the first line as its input.

The second rule deals with what characters are used to represent the sequence. Swellix only knows how to handle
sequences which consist of A, C, G, and U representing the nucleotides. If there are spaces, place holders, nucleotides
with chemical modifications, etc., Swellix will not properly handle the sequence. The output from the program will be
either incorrect or, even worse, the program will crash. So, any special characters need to be either removed or properly
converted back to their corresponding A, C, G, or U.

e.g.
Imagine that you have a sequence to run which contains some place-holding characters. For example, let the sequence look
like `GCUCU--AAAAGA---GAG`.
Since Swellix doesn't know what to do with these hyphens, you must first strip them from the sequence and then adhere to
the previous one line rule. So, when sending this sequence to Swellix it should look exactly like the previous example:
`GCUCUAAAAGAGAG`.

e.g.
Now consider the case where there is some number of modified nucleotides which constrain the folding of the RNA. Let the
sequence be `GCUCU"AAAKAGAG`, where `"` represents the 1-methyladenosine modification and `K` represents the
1-methylguanosine modification. (these modifications are arbitrarily chosen for the example)
We've stated that Swellix can't handle these characters properly on its own, so we need to first convert them to their
unmodified characters. So the sequence will once again look like `GCUCUAAAAGAGAG` to Swellix. 


Fourth: Providing Input to Swellix
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Swellix can accept input in two ways: standard input, and an input file specified with the `-i` flag. In addition, you can
specify most folding constraints via the commandline. For the others, you must provide them in you configuration file.


### STANDARD INPUT:
To use standard input, simply pipe a sequence to Swellix like so:
```
echo "GCUCUAAAAGAGAG" | /path/to/swellix/swellix.exe [desired constraints]
```
where the desired constraints are some optional combination of the flags defined at the bottom of this file.


### FILE INPUT:
There are two flavors of reading input from a file. In one, only the first line of the file, which should be the sequence,
is read into the program. In the other, you can instruct Swellix to continue reading through the file to look for any
defined constraints. For the second case, we'll refer to that file as a configuration file since it is providing Swellix
with more information than just the sequence.

In general, to use a plain input file you need the `-i` flag and the path to the file.
```
/path/to/swellix/swellix.exe -i sequence.txt [optional command-line args]
```

However, if you would like to provide a configuration file with certain folding constraints, you will also need to include
the `-k` flag. You will still use the `-i` flag and the path to your config file.
```
/path/to/swellix/swellix.exe -k -i config.swlx [optional args/constraints not in config file]
```

### ABOUT THE CONFIGURATION FILE:
There are many constraints that can be imposed just by command line arguments. The advantage of providing input via a
config file is that you can specify constraints such as individual nucleotide pairing restrictions. For example, you can
tell Swellix that any particular nucleotide absolutely must pair to form a valid structure. The constraints provided must
be in a strict format for the time being. The specific formatting rules and an example of a properly written config file
is provided. It is called `configTutorial.swlx`. In this file, we use the same sequence as above but illustrate how to 
specify constraints.

**_NOTE_**
If the case arises where you have provided input via both standard input and an input file, the sequence defined by the
input file will override the sequence provided by standard input.
