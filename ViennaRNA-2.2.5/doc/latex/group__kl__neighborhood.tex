\subsection{Detailed Description}
Compute Thermodynamic properties for a Distance Class Partitioning of the Secondary Structure Space. 

All functions related to this group implement the basic recursions for M\+F\+E folding, partition function computation and stochastic backtracking with a {\itshape classified} {\itshape dynamic} {\itshape programming} approach. The secondary structure space is divided into partitions according to the base pair distance to two given reference structures and all relevant properties are calculated for each of the resulting partitions \begin{DoxySeeAlso}{See also}
