[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
RNAfold 2.2.5
.PP
Calculate minimum free energy secondary structures and partition function of
RNAs
.PP
The program reads RNA sequences, calculates their minimum free energy (mfe)
structure and prints the mfe structure in bracket notation and its free energy.
If not specified differently using commandline arguments, input is accepted
from stdin, and output printed to stdout. If the \fB\-p\fR option was given it also
computes the partition function (pf) and base pairing probability matrix, and
prints the free energy of the thermodynamic ensemble, the frequency of the mfe
structure in the ensemble, and the ensemble diversity to stdout.
.PP
It also produces PostScript files with plots of the resulting secondary
structure graph and a "dot plot" of the base pairing matrix.
The dot plot shows a matrix of squares with area proportional to the pairing
probability in the upper right half, and one square for each pair in the
minimum free energy structure in the lower left half. For each pair i\-j with
probability p>10E\-6 there is a line of the form
.PP
i  j  sqrt(p)  ubox
.PP
in the PostScript file, so that the pair probabilities can be easily extracted.
.PP
Sequences may be provided in a simple text format where each sequence occupies
a single line. Output files are named "rna.ps" and "dot.ps". Existing files
of the same name will be overwritten.
It is also possible to provide sequence data in FASTA format. In this case, the
first word (max. 42 char) of the FASTA header will be used for output file
names. PostScript files "name_ss.ps" and "name_dp.ps" are produced for the
structure and dot plot, respectively.
Once FASTA input was provided all following sequences must be in FASTA format
too.
The program will continue to read new sequences until a line consisting of the
single character @ or an end of file condition is encountered.

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Command line options which alter the general behavior of this program
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-infile=\fR<filename>
Read a file instead of reading from stdin
.IP
The default behavior of RNAfold is to read input from stdin. Using this
parameter the user can specify an input file name where data is read from.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-outfile=\fR<filename>
Print output to file instead of stdout
.IP
Specifying a file name/prefix will print the output into a file instead of
stdout. If a FASTA header precedes the input sequence, the appropriate fasta
ID is used as infix for the file name. Each generated file will be suffixed
with the file extension '.fold'. If a file with the same filename already
exists, any output of the program will be appended to it.
.TP
\fB\-\-noPS\fR
Do not produce postscript drawing of the mfe
structure.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-layout\-type\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Choose the layout algorithm. Simple radial
layout if 0, or naview if 1
.IP
(default=`1')
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitude nucleotide
"T" with "U"
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Structure Constraints:"
.IP
Command line options to interact with the structure constraints feature of
this program
.TP
\fB\-\-maxBPspan\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Set the maximum base pair span
(default=`\-1')
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-constraint[=\fR<filename>] Calculate structures subject to constraints.
(default=`')
.IP
The program reads first the sequence, then a string containing constraints on
the structure encoded with the symbols:
.IP
\&. (no constraint for this base)
.IP
| (the corresponding base has to be paired
.IP
x (the base is unpaired)
.IP
< (base i is paired with a base j>i)
.IP
\f(CW> (base i is paired with a base j<i)\fR
.IP
and matching brackets ( ) (base i pairs base j)
.IP
With the exception of "|", constraints will disallow all pairs conflicting
with the constraint. This is usually sufficient to enforce the constraint,
but occasionally a base may stay unpaired in spite of constraints. PF folding
ignores constraints of type "|".
.TP
\fB\-\-batch\fR
Use constraints for multiple sequences.
(default=off)
.IP
Usually, constraints provided from input file only apply to a single input
sequence. Therefore, RNAfold will stop its computation and quit after the
first input sequence was processed. Using this switch, RNAfold processes
multiple input sequences and applies the same provided constraints to each of
them.
.TP
\fB\-\-canonicalBPonly\fR
Remove non\-canonical base pairs from the
structure constraint
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-enforceConstraint\fR
Enforce base pairs given by round brackets ( )
in structure constraint
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-shape=\fR<filename>
Use SHAPE reactivity data to guide structure
predictions
.TP
\fB\-\-shapeMethod\fR=\fI\,[D\/\fR/Z/W] + [optional parameters]
Specify the method how to convert SHAPE
.TP
reactivity data to pseudo energy
contributions
.IP
(default=`D')
.IP
The following methods can be used to convert SHAPE reactivities into pseudo
energy contributions.
.IP
\&'D': Convert by using a linear equation according to Deigan et al 2009. The
calculated pseudo energies will be applied for every nucleotide involved in a
stacked pair. This method is recognized by a capital 'D' in the provided
parameter, i.e.: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"D" is the default setting. The slope 'm'
and the intercept 'b' can be set to a non\-default value if necessary,
otherwise m=1.8 and b=\-0.6. To alter these parameters, e.g. m=1.9 and b=\-0.7,
use a parameter string like this: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Dm1.9b\-0.7". You may also
provide only one of the two parameters like: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Dm1.9" or
\fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Db\-0.7".
.IP
\&'Z': Convert SHAPE reactivities to pseudo energies according to Zarringhalam
et al 2012. SHAPE reactivities will be converted to pairing probabilities by
using linear mapping. Aberration from the observed pairing probabilities will
be penalized during the folding recursion. The magnitude of the penalties can
affected by adjusting the factor beta (e.g. \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Zb0.8").
.IP
\&'W': Apply a given vector of perturbation energies to unpaired nucleotides
according to Washietl et al 2012. Perturbation vectors can be calculated by
using RNApvmin.
.TP
\fB\-\-shapeConversion\fR=\fI\,M\/\fR/C/S/L/O
+ [optional parameters]
Specify the method used to convert SHAPE
.TP
reactivities to pairing probabilities when
using the SHAPE approach of Zarringhalam et
al.
.IP
(default=`O')
.IP
The following methods can be used to convert SHAPE reactivities into the
probability for a certain nucleotide to be unpaired.
.IP
\&'M': Use linear mapping according to Zarringhalam et al.
\&'C': Use a cutoff\-approach to divide into paired and unpaired nucleotides
(e.g. "C0.25")
\&'S': Skip the normalizing step since the input data already represents
probabilities for being unpaired rather than raw reactivity values
\&'L': Use a linear model to convert the reactivity into a probability for
being unpaired (e.g. "Ls0.68i0.2" to use a slope of 0.68 and an intercept
of 0.2)
\&'O': Use a linear model to convert the log of the reactivity into a
probability for being unpaired (e.g. "Os1.6i\-2.29" to use a slope of 1.6
and an intercept of \fB\-2\fR.29)
.TP
\fB\-\-motif\fR=\fI\,SEQUENCE\/\fR,STRUCTURE,ENERGY
Specify stabilizing effect of ligand binding to
.IP
a particular sequence/structure motif.
.IP
Some ligands binding to RNAs require and/or induce particular sequence and
structure motifs. For instance they bind to an interior loop, or small
hairpin loop. If for such cases a binding free energy is known, the binding
and therefore stabilizing effect of the ligand can be included in the folding
recursions. Interior loop motifs are specified as concatenations of 5' and 3'
motif, separated by an '&' character.
.IP
Energy contributions must be specified in kcal/mol.
.IP
See the manpage for an example usage of this option.
.SS "Algorithms:"
.IP
Select additional algorithms which should be included in the calculations.
The Minimum free energy (MFE) and a structure representative are calculated
in any case.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-partfunc\fR[=\fI\,INT\/\fR]
Calculate the partition function and base
pairing probability matrix.
.IP
(default=`1')
.IP
In addition to the MFE structure we print a coarse representation of the pair
probabilities in form of a pseudo bracket notation followed by the ensemble
free energy. This notation makes use of the letters " . , | { } ( ) "
denoting bases that are essentially unpaired, weakly paired, strongly paired
without preference, weakly upstream (downstream) paired, or strongly up\-
(down\-)stream paired bases, respectively. On the next line the centroid
structure as derived from the pair probabilities together with its free
energy and distance to the ensemble is shown. Finally it prints the frequency
of the mfe structure, and the structural diversity (mean distance between the
structures in the ensemble).
See the description of pf_fold() and mean_bp_dist() and centroid() in the
RNAlib documentation for details.
Note that unless you also specify \fB\-d2\fR or \fB\-d0\fR, the partition function and mfe
calculations will use a slightly different energy model. See the discussion
of dangling end options below.
.IP
An additionally passed value to this option changes the behavior of partition
function calculation:
\fB\-p0\fR Calculate the partition function but not the pair probabilities, saving
about 50% in runtime. This prints the ensemble free energy \fB\-kT\fR ln(Z).
\fB\-p2\fR Compute stack probabilities, i.e. the probability that a pair (i,j) and
the immediately interior pair (i+1,j\-1) are formed simultaneously in addition
to pair probabilities. A second postscript dot plot called "name_dp2.ps",
or "dot2.ps" (if the sequence does not have a name), is produced that
contains pair probabilities in the upper right half and stack probabilities
in the lower left.
.TP
\fB\-\-MEA\fR[=\fI\,gamma\/\fR]
Calculate an MEA (maximum expected accuracy)
structure, where the expected accuracy is
computed from the pair probabilities: each
base pair (i,j) gets a score 2*gamma*p_ij and
the score of an unpaired base is given by the
probability of not forming a pair.
.IP
(default=`1.')
.IP
The parameter gamma tunes the importance of correctly predicted pairs versus
unpaired bases. Thus, for small values of gamma the MEA structure will
contain only pairs with very high probability.
Using \fB\-\-MEA\fR implies \fB\-p\fR for computing the pair probabilities.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-pfScale\fR=\fI\,scaling\/\fR factor
In the calculation of the pf use scale*mfe as
an estimate for the ensemble free energy
(used to avoid overflows).
.IP
The default is 1.07, useful values are 1.0 to 1.2. Occasionally needed for
long sequences.
You can also recompile the program to use double precision (see the README
file).
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-circ\fR
Assume a circular (instead of linear) RNA
molecule.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-ImFeelingLucky\fR
Return exactly one stochastically backtracked
structure
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
This function computes the partition function and returns exactly one
secondary structure stochastically sampled from the Boltzmann equilibrium
according to its probability in the ensemble
.TP
\fB\-\-bppmThreshold=\fR<value>
Set the threshold for base pair probabilities
included in the postscript output
.IP
(default=`1e\-5')
.IP
By setting the threshold the base pair probabilities that are included in the
output can be varied. By default only those exceeding 1e\-5 in probability
will be shown as squares in the dot plot. Changing the threshold to any other
value allows for increase or decrease of data.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gquad\fR
Incoorporate G\-Quadruplex formation into the
structure prediction algorithm
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of
temp C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop
hairpins. Mostly for testing.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for
bases adjacent to helices in free ends and
multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d1\fR only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end,
this is the default for mfe folding but unsupported for the partition
function folding.
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases
adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for
partition function folding (\fB\-p\fR).
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
With \fB\-d3\fR mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in
multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking
of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works only for mfe
folding.
.IP
Note that by default (as well as with \fB\-d1\fR and \fB\-d3\fR) pf and mfe folding treat
dangling ends differently. Use \fB\-d2\fR in addition to \fB\-p\fR to ensure that both
algorithms use the same energy model.
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Produce structures without lonely pairs
(helices of length 1).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur
isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fI\,paramfile\/\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead
of using the default parameter set.
.IP
A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \fB\-nsp\fR \fB\-GA\fR  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC
(\fB\-e\fR 1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
.TP
\fB\-\-betaScale\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Set the scaling of the Boltzmann factors
(default=`1.')
.IP
The argument provided with this option enables to scale the thermodynamic
temperature used in the Boltzmann factors independently from the temperature
used to scale the individual energy contributions of the loop types. The
Boltzmann factors then become exp(\fB\-dG\fR/(kT*betaScale)) where k is the
Boltzmann constant, dG the free energy contribution of the state and T the
absolute temperature.

.SH EXAMPLES

Single line sequence input and calculation of partition function and MEA structure

.nf
.ft CW
  $ RNAfold --MEA -d2 -p
.ft
.fi
  
The program will then prompt for sequence input. Using the example sequence
"CGACGTAGATGCTAGCTGACTCGATGC" and pressing ENTER the output of the program will be
similar to

.nf
.ft CW
  CGACGUAGAUGCUAGCUGACUCGAUGC
  (((.((((.......)).)))))....
   minimum free energy =  -1.90 kcal/mol
  (((.((((.......))},})))....
   free energy of ensemble =  -2.86 kcal/mol
  (((.(.((.......))..)))).... {  0.80 d=2.81}
  (((.((((.......))).)))).... { -1.90 MEA=22.32}
   frequency of mfe structure in ensemble 0.20997; ensemble diversity 4.19
.ft
.fi


Here, the first line just repeats the sequence input. The second line contains a
MFE structure in dot bracket notation followed by the minimum free energy. After
this, the pairing probabilities for each nucleotide are shown in a pseudo dot-bracket
notation followed by the free energy of ensemble. The next two lines show the centroid
structure with its free energy and its distance to the ensemble as well as the MEA structure,
its free energy and the maximum expected accuracy, respectively. The last line finally
contains the frequency of the MFE representative in the complete ensemble of secondary
structures and the ensemble diversity. For further details about the calculation and
interpretation of the given output refer to the reference manual of RNAlib.

Since version 2.0 it is also possible to provide FASTA file sequence input. Assume
you have a file containing two sequences in FASTA format, e.g

.nf
.ft CW
  $ cat sequences.fa
  >seq1
  CGGCUCGCAACAGACCUAUUAGUUUUACGUAAUAUUUG

  >seq2
  GAAUGACCCGAUAACCCCGUAAUAUUUGGAACGAUCUA
  UAACACGACUUCACUCUU
.ft
.fi

In order to compute the MFE for the two sequences the user can use the following
command

.nf
.ft CW
  $ RNAfold < sequences.fa
.ft
.fi

which would result in an output like this

.nf
.ft CW
  >seq1
  CGGCUCGCAACAGACCUAUUAGUUUUACGUAAUAUUUGGAACGAUCUAUAACACGACUUCACUCUU
  .((.(((...((((..(((((........)))))))))...))).))................... ( -5.40)

  GAAUGACCCGAUAACCCCGUAAUAUUUGGAACGAUCUAUAACACGACUUCACUCUU
  .......((((..............))))........................... ( -2.00)
.ft
.fi
.SH "CONSTRAINT EXAMPLES"

Secondary structure constraints may be given in addition to the sequence information, too.
Using the first sequence of the previous example and restricting the nucleotides of the
outermost helix to be unpaired, i.e. base pairs (2,47) and (3,46) the input file should
have the following form

.nf
.ft CW
  $ cat sequence_unpaired.fa
  >seq1
  CGGCUCGCAACAGACCUAUUAGUUUUACGUAAUAUUUG
  GAACGAUCUAUAACACGACUUCACUCUU
  .xx...................................
  .......xx...................
.ft
.fi

Calling RNAfold with the structure constraint option -C it shows the following result

.nf
.ft CW
  $ RNAfold -C < sequence_unpaired.fa
  >seq1
  CGGCUCGCAACAGACCUAUUAGUUUUACGUAAUAUUUGGAACGAUCUAUAACACGACUUCACUCUU
  ....(((...((((..(((((........)))))))))...)))...................... ( -4.20)
.ft
.fi

This represents the minimum free energy and a structure representative of the RNA
sequence given that nucleotides 2,3,46 and 47 must not be involved in any base pair.
For further information about constrained folding refer to the details of the -C option
and the reference manual of RNAlib.

Since version 2.2 the ViennaRNA Package distinguishes hard and soft constraints.
As a consequence, structure predictions are easily amenable to a versatile set of constraints,
such as maximal base pair span, incorporation of SHAPE reactivity data, and RNA-ligand binding
to hairpin, or interior loop motifs.

.I Restricting the maximal span of a base pair

A convenience commandline option allows you to easily limit the distance (j - i + 1) between
two nucleotides i and j that form a basepair. For instance a limit of 600nt can be accomplished
using:

.nf
.ft CW
  $ RNAfold --maxBPspan 600
.ft
.fi

.I Guide structure prediction with SHAPE reactivity data

Use SHAPE reactivity data to guide secondary structure prediction:

.nf
.ft CW
  $ RNAfold --shape=reactivities.dat < sequence.fa
.ft
.fi

where the file reactivities.dat is a two column text file with sequence positions (1-based)
and normalized reactivity values (usually between 0 and 2. Missing values may be left out,
or assigned a negative score:

.nf
.ft CW
  $ cat reactivities.dat
  9    -999       # No reactivity information
  10   -999
  11   0.042816   # normalized SHAPE reactivity
  12   0          # also a valid SHAPE reactivity
  15   0.15027    # Missing data for pos. 13-14
  ...
  42   0.16201
.ft
.fi

Note, that RNAfold will only process the first sequence in the input file, when provided
with SHAPE reactivity data!

.I More complex structure constraints

Structure constraints beyond those that can be expressed with a pseudo-dot bracket notation
may be provided in a constraints definition file:

.nf
.ft CW
  $ RNAfold --constraint=constraints.txt < sequence.fa
.ft
.fi

where the constraints definition file syntax is a generalization of those used in
UNAfold/mfold. Each line starts with a single character command, followed by three
or four numbers. In addition, optional auxiliary modifier characters may be used
to limit the constraint to specific loop types. For base pair specific constraints,
we currently distinguish pairs in exterior loops (E), closing pairs of hairpin
loops (H), closing (I) and enclosed (i) pairs of interior loops, and closing (M)
and enclosed (m) pairs of multibranch loops. Nucleotide-wise constraints may be
limited to their loop context using the corresponding uppercase characters. The
default is to apply a constraint to all (A) loop types. Furthermore, pairing
constraints for single nucleotides may be limited to upstream (U), or downstream (D)
orientation. The constraint definition file specification is as follows:

.nf
.ft CW
  F i 0 k   [TYPE] [ORIENTATION] # Force nucleotides i...i+k-1 to be paired
  F i j k   [TYPE] # Force helix of size k starting with (i,j) to be formed
  P i 0 k   [TYPE] # Prohibit nucleotides i...i+k-1 to be paired
  P i j k   [TYPE] # Prohibit pairs (i,j),...,(i+k-1,j-k+1)
  P i-j k-l [TYPE] # Prohibit pairing between two ranges
  C i 0 k   [TYPE] # Nucleotides i,...,i+k-1 must appear in context TYPE
  C i j k          # Remove pairs conflicting with (i,j),...,(i+k-1,j-k+1)
  E i 0 k e        # Add pseudo-energy e to nucleotides i...i+k-1
  E i j k e        # Add pseudo-energy e to pairs (i,j),...,(i+k-1,j-k+1)

                   # [TYPE]        = { E, H, I, i, M, m, A }
                   # [ORIENTATION] = { U, D }
.ft
.fi

Again, RNAfold by default only processes the first sequence in the input sequence
when provided with a constraints definition file. To apply the exact same constraints
to each of the input sequences in a multi FASTA file, use the batch mode commandline
option:

.nf
.ft CW
  $ RNAfold --constraint=constraints.txt --batch < sequences.fa
.ft
.fi

.I Ligand binding contributions to specific hairpin/interior loop motifs

A convenience function allows to specify a hairping/interior loop motif where a ligand
is binding with a particular binding free energy dG.
Here is an example that adds a theophylline binding motif. Free energy contribution of
this motif of dG=-9.22kcal/mol is derived from k_d=0.32umol/l, taken from Jenison et al.
1994. Although the structure motif consists of a symmetric interior loop of size 6,
followed by a small helix of 3 basepairs, and a bulge of 3 nucleotides, the entire
structure can still be represented by one interior loop.
See the below mofif description where the '&' character splits the motif into a 5' and
a 3' part. The first line gives the sequences motif, the second line shows the actual
structure motif of the aptamer pocket, and the third line is the interior loop motif
that fully encapsulates the theophylline aptamer:

.nf
.ft CW
  GAUACCAG&CCCUUGGCAGC
  (...((((&)...)))...)
  (......(&).........)
.ft
.fi

To use the above information in the folding recursions of RNAfold, one only needs to
provide the motif itself, and binding free energy:

.nf
.ft CW
  $ RNAfold --motif="GAUACCAG&CCCUUGGCAGC,(...((((&)...)))...),-9.22" < sequences.fa
.ft
.fi
