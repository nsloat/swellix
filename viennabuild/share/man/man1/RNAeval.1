.SH SYNOPSIS
.B RNAeval
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
RNAeval 2.2.5
.PP
calculate energy of RNA sequences with given secondary structure
.PP
Evaluates the free energy of an RNA molecule in fixed secondary structure.
Sequences and structures are read alternately from stdin. The energy in
Kcal/Mol is written to stdout.
The program will continue to read new sequences and structures until a line
consisting of the single character "@" or an end of file condition is
encountered.
If the input sequence or structure contains the separator character "&" the
program calculates the energy of the co\-folding of two RNA strands, where the
"&" marks the boundary between the two strands.

.TP
\fB\-\-detailed\-help\fR
Print help, including all details and hidden
options, and exit

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Below are command line options which alter the general behavior of this
program
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitude nucleotide
"T" with "U"
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print out energy contribution of each loop in
the structure.
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of
temp C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop
hairpins. Mostly for testing.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for
bases adjacent to helices in free ends and
multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d1\fR only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end,
this unsupported for the partition function folding.
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases
adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for
partition function folding (\fB\-p\fR).
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
With \fB\-d3\fR mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in
multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking
of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC
(\fB\-e\fR 1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fI\,paramfile\/\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead
of using the default parameter set.
.IP
A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-circ\fR
Assume a circular (instead of linear) RNA
molecule.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gquad\fR
Incoorporate G\-Quadruplex formation into the
structure prediction algorithm
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-logML\fR
Recalculate energies of structures using a
logarithmic energy function for multi\-loops
before output.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
This option does not effect structure generation, only the energies that are
printed out. Since logML lowers energies somewhat, some structures may be
missing.
.TP
\fB\-\-shape\fR=\fI\,SHAPE\/\fR file
Use SHAPE reactivity data in the folding
recursions (does not work for PF yet)
.TP
\fB\-\-shapeMethod\fR=\fI\,[D\/\fR/Z/W] + [optional parameters]
Specify the method how to convert SHAPE
.TP
reactivity data to pseudo energy
contributions
.IP
(default=`D')
.IP
The following methods can be used to convert SHAPE reactivities into pseudo
energy contributions.
.IP
\&'D': Convert by using a linear equation according to Deigan et al 2009. The
calculated pseudo energies will be applied for every nucleotide involved in a
stacked pair. This method is recognized by a capital 'D' in the provided
parameter, i.e.: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"D" is the default setting. The slope 'm'
and the intercept 'b' can be set to a non\-default value if necessary,
otherwise m=1.8 and b=\-0.6. To alter these parameters, e.g. m=1.9 and b=\-0.7,
use a parameter string like this: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Dm1.9b\-0.7". You may also
provide only one of the two parameters like: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Dm1.9" or
\fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Db\-0.7".
.IP
\&'Z': Convert SHAPE reactivities to pseudo energies according to Zarringhalam
et al 2012. SHAPE reactivities will be converted to pairing probabilities by
using linear mapping. Aberration from the observed pairing probabilities will
be penalized during the folding recursion. The magnitude of the penalties can
affected by adjusting the factor beta (e.g. \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Zb0.8").
.IP
\&'W': Apply a given vector of perturbation energies to unpaired nucleotides
according to Washietl et al 2012. Perturbation vectors can be calculated by
using RNApvmin.
.TP
\fB\-\-shapeConversion\fR=\fI\,M\/\fR/C/S/L/O
+ [optional parameters]
Specify the method used to convert SHAPE
.TP
reactivities to pairing probabilities when
using the SHAPE approach of Zarringhalam et
al.
.IP
(default=`O')
.IP
The following methods can be used to convert SHAPE reactivities into the
probability for a certain nucleotide to be unpaired.
.IP
\&'M': Use linear mapping according to Zarringhalam et al.
\&'C': Use a cutoff\-approach to divide into paired and unpaired nucleotides
(e.g. "C0.25")
\&'S': Skip the normalizing step since the input data already represents
probabilities for being unpaired rather than raw reactivity values
\&'L': Use a linear model to convert the reactivity into a probability for
being unpaired (e.g. "Ls0.68i0.2" to use a slope of 0.68 and an intercept
of 0.2)
\&'O': Use a linear model to convert the log of the reactivity into a
probability for being unpaired (e.g. "Os1.6i\-2.29" to use a slope of 1.6
and an intercept of \fB\-2\fR.29)
